/*
 * Lightweight mutex.
 *
 * Has the same functionality as a regular mutex. We aren't using the lw_rwlock
 * (which is a read-write lock) for this as that only has a write lock bit but
 * doesn't track the current owner. Since we don't need a reader count, we can
 * track the owner and hence do deadlock detection in the version below. If
 * someday we decide to increase lw_rwlock size to be 8 bytes and track the
 * writer thread waiter id as well, this could be considered a more compact
 * that delivers the same functionality.
